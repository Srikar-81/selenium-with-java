**Selenium Automation Learning Project**

**Overview**:

      This repository is a collection of Selenium WebDriver automation test scripts that I created while learning web automation. 
      The scripts cover key automation tasks such as working with like 
            Handling alerts (e.g., accepting, dismissing, and retrieving alert text)
            Managing dropdowns (e.g., selecting values from dropdown lists)
            Simulating mouse actions (e.g., clicking, hovering, and drag-and-drop)
            Triggering keyboard events (e.g., sending keys to fields, simulating keyboard shortcuts)
            Executing navigation commands (e.g., navigating forward, backward, and refreshing the page) and other more events.
      These are the fundamental tasks that are commonly needed when testing web applications.

**Project Structure:**

            Accordian.java             # Interacts with and tests accordion UI elements
            
            Alert2.java                # Handles simple alert pop-ups and validates their content
            
            Alerts.java                # Handles and verifies multiple alert types: Simple, Confirm, Prompt
            
            Alerts3.java               # Advanced Alert handling with multiple alerts in sequence
            
            BrowserCommands.java       # Executes browser commands such as refresh, back, and forward
            
            Dropdown.java              # Handles dropdown menu interactions and selections
            
            Keyboardactions.java       # Simulates keyboard events like pressing special keys (Ctrl, Alt)
            
            MouseActions.java          # Performs mouse-related actions such as clicks, hovering, etc.
            
            Navigation Commands.java   # Demonstrates browser navigation, opening new tabs/windows, and back/forward
            
            Url.java                   # Verifies and interacts with different URLs and checks page titles
            
            broken.java                # Handles and validates broken links on a webpage
            
            iframes.java               # Switches between main window and iframes to interact with elements
            
            login.java                 # Automates a simple login form
            
            screen.java                # Captures and saves screenshots during test execution
            
            seleniumAutomation.java    # A combined script showcasing various actions using Selenium


**Technologies used**

   **Java** The primary programming language for writing test scripts.
